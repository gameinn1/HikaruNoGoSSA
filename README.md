# HikaruNoGoSSA
Restoration of the original Hikaru No Go fansub in Substation Alpha (SSA) format, done by Elite-Fansubs [E-F] / Real Fansubbers [R-F].

The used fonts are in fonts.7z, either extract and right click install them, or use mkvmerge to multiplex it with the episodes.

## Progress
- 1-52 done
- 53-61 wip
- 62- Done by me

Hello everyone. This is an update to the project started by gabest11. I don't know how long it will take but will be done.

Changelog since starting:

Subbed 62. Considering doing the extra Go sections at the end of each episode. Will see but since gabest11 didn't do them, would need to sub them first.
Fixed typo in intro of episode 61. "wth my wings spread out."

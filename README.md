Restoration of the original Hikaru No Go fansub in Substation Alpha (SSA) format, done by Elite-Fansubs [E-F] / Real Fansubbers [R-F].

Hello everyone. This is an update to the project started by gabest11. See table below for overall progress. The fonts are in fonts-v4.zip (compiled via fonts collector) as this has everything needed and made once 75/76 was complete. Once extracted, right click and install them.

## Intro/Progress
I restarted this project in late December 2025 after it was laid dormant by gabest11 (they stopped around episode 60). Before this I had no experience with Aegisub. I assumed that the work done by gabest11 was close to done but... there is some small problems. Most of the time they did not assign styling and there is generally some small differences between E-F/R-F/timing can be slightly off. This all needs relooked at.

I did pretty well in recreating episode 1. Everything is there with all the quirks of early E-F subs. From episode 2 onwards, I have considered changing the titles to the more modern versions that R-F did as it looks far better. I just decided to do Episode 1 exactly the same style as E-F had done as a sort of tribute.

The subbing for the ending Igo sections is not what what E-F/R-F did so they also have to get properly resubbed as I make my way through. I also properly subbed 75 Igo so I atleast had done the start and end of Igo... just not the inbetween. I want to make it clear that all ending Igo is technically now done but just non E-F/R-F versions for the majority.

I am pretty sure gabest11 just took existing subs (similar to E-F/R-F for the main body) and transplanted them in and then added the opening and ending sections. The problem here is you get no styling and the timing at points isn't the best. I don't want to sound ungrateful to gabest11. The work they did in subbing the intro and endings is remarkable that this can somewhat be attempted.

What I am happy about is episodes 62 to 75 since I was in control from the start. Every line is identical to R-F and timing is almost perfect. I was frame advancing most of the time. The problem now? As one person I'm really struggling to do 75 episodes. We're talking multiple months if it wants to get to the level of say Episode 1 or 75. I asked for help on some forums and I do want to give a big thank you to llbx. Things they did:

1: Perfectly recreated the "Music is my Thing" karaoke ending that gabest11 did not get around to (starts episode 64). That was one of the last big hurdles for anyone wanting to actually properly restore the subs.

2: Perfectly recreated the episode 75 ending karaoke! This was the last big hurdle for a successful sub. It's very nice go check it out!

3: Perfectly recreated the episode title animations. These will be put on all episodes (as talked about above).

It's funny because even with the subs in this state, it's still the best subs for this anime. Why? At the bare minimum you get the subs already available elsewhere with a somewhat complete ending Igo, but you also get the added opening and ending karaoke parts from start to finish for every episode.

As I type it's January 2nd 2026. Having to go retime and style 3-61 plus properly sub the Igo sections is a big task. I'm glad I put enough effort in to have this in a state where it's basically just a time investment now.

If anyone ever sees this and has a passion to properly finish, I'd like to see it done. You can reach me on Discord at gameinn1 or make an Issues post. If you need it visualized of what work needs to be done, below is a table.

Update: January 4th 2026. I've decided to restore the AonE subs for the New Year Special (Episode 76). This will be uploaded to give more eyes on the project. It's over an hour and I have to start from scratch so probably a week or so. The current DVD/Blu-Ray subs are bad (mainly timing wise) and needs done.

Update: January 9th 2026. The New Year/Hokuto Cup special (ep 76) has been fully subbed! As for the main episodes, I may consider doing an episode per week (starting from 3) but for now I am looking at getting the special uploaded to get more eyes on the project.

Below is old info. Leaving here for completion sake.

Fixed a typo/grammar in the R-F sub episode 62. "A bluff? He's doesn't do stuff like that" to "A bluff? He doesn't do stuff like that".

Subbed 62. Considering doing the extra Go sections at the end of each episode. Will see but since gabest11 didn't do them, would need to sub them all first.

Fixed typo in intro of episode 61 by gabest11. "wth my wings spread out." to "with my wings spread out."

Done 63 and here is where I considered changing colours for styles. gabest11 "Noise" style was wrong compared to E-F/R-F. gabest11 was italic, alignment 8. It should be bold, alignment 2. Changed "Noise" to "Background" as it makes more sense.

I color picked Background again (now it's &H00C5FEC1) but unsure if it's totally faithful (maybe it's 99%).

Also made a Sai "Blue" styling (&H00FEFECE) for earlier E-F (this got dropped later on by E-F/R-F but let's recreate it as best we can)

Made a "Memory" purple styling that shows up as early as episode 1. gabest11 also did not do this style.

The main idea is to just get things subbed and then can worry about slight colour and changes later. I am mainly making sure that Thinking, Background, Sai and Memory are assigned properly. I will have to go back over gabest11 subs from scratch and apply "Memory" styling to more accurately reflect E-F/R-F.

Subbed 64 ending (music is my thing) with help from llbx. This is the main hurdle done!

Small note: In Episode 74, there is actually a difference between the TV broadcast and Blu-Ray. At about 4:32, Shindou talks about doing a Suberi and "If I want to win.". Those lines are not in the TV broadcast at all and that line of Suberi actually plays as he puts the stone down on R-F about 8 seconds later but it makes more sense for that to be "There you go!". If that's wrong then someone can let me know.

Below is a small changelog for episode 1:

Took some liberties with E-F sub styling for episode 1. For example during the memory sequence of Sai and Hikaru (starting around 4:36 on E-F), E-F did this with Default styling but it really should be Background styling. They even apply the Background styling sometimes (e.g. "What are you?" at 4:41) so I guess they just forgot to apply it in places. They also applied Background to Sai talking (4:37) instead of the Sai styling which makes more sense.

Around 11:54 they styled Hikaru as Sai so that got changed to Background which again seems to make the most sense. I started to apply the Thinking style starting with Touya saying "That's the way a beginner holds a stone...". E-F only started doing the Thinking style in later episodes but no reason not to do it from the start. As things progressed I realise I should be doing small improvements like this.

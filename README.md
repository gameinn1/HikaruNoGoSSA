# HikaruNoGoSSA
Hello everyone. This is an update to the project started by gabest11. I don't know how long it will take but will be done.

Restoration of the original Hikaru No Go fansub in Substation Alpha (SSA) format, done by Elite-Fansubs [E-F] / Real Fansubbers [R-F].

The used fonts are in fonts.7z, either extract and right click install them, or use mkvmerge to multiplex it with the episodes.

## Progress
- 1-61 wip (gabest11 work needs relooked at)
- 62-66 Done by me (these I am confident in since I did them)
- Yes if you're wondering the "Music is my Thing" ending has been painstakingly recreated. It's frame perfect to R-F. Check 64 onwards.

Changelog since starting (sorry for how this is all laid out I barely know how Github works).

Fixed a typo/grammar in the R-F sub episode 62. "A bluff? He's doesn't do stuff like that" to "A bluff? He doesn't do stuff like that".

Subbed 62. Considering doing the extra Go sections at the end of each episode. Will see but since gabest11 didn't do them, would need to sub them all first.

Fixed typo in intro of episode 61 by gabest11. "wth my wings spread out." to "with my wings spread out."

Done 63 and here is where I considered changing colours for styles. gabest11 "Noise" style was wrong compared to E-F/R-F. gabest11 was italic, alignment 8. It should be bold, alignment 2.

I color picked Noise again but unsure if it's totally faithful (maybe it's 99%).

Also made a Sai "Blue" styling for earlier E-F (this got dropped later on by E-F/R-F but let's recreate it as best we can)

Made a "Memory" purple styling that shows up as early as episode 1. gabest11 also did not do this style.

The main idea is to just get things subbed and then can worry about slight colour and changes later. I am mainly making sure that Noise, Sai and Memory are assigned properly. I will have to go back over gabest11 subs from scratch and apply "Memory" styling to more accurately reflect E-F/R-F.

Subbed 64 with music is my thing. This is the main hurdle done!

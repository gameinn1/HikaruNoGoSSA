Hello everyone. This is an update to the project started by gabest11.

Restoration of the original Hikaru No Go fansub in Substation Alpha (SSA) format, done by Elite-Fansubs [E-F] / Real Fansubbers [R-F].

The fonts are in fonts.7z (this is from gabest11). You probably want to look at fonts-updated.zip instead (compiled via fonts collector) as this has everything needed and made once 75/76 was complete. Once extracted, right click and install them.

## Progress
I restarted this project in late December 2025 after it was laid dormant by gabest11. Before this I had literally no experience with Aegisub. I assumed that the work done by gabest11 was close to done... but it's really not. To show the stark differences, please look at my episode 1 and 2 compared to theirs. They did not assign styling.

I did pretty well in recreating episode 1. Literally everything is there. Basically perfect timing to E-F, good styling and proper Igo subbing with all the quirks of early E-F subs. That's another thing, the subbing for the ending Igo sections is nowhere near what E-F did so they also have to get properly resubbed from 3 onwards. I also properly subbed 75 Igo so I atleast had done the start and end of Igo... just not the inbetween. :P

I am pretty sure gabest11 just took existing subs (similar to E-F/R-F for the main body) and transplanted them in and then added the opening and ending sections. The problem here is you get no styling and the timing at points isn't the best.

I don't want to sound ungrateful to gabest11 here. The work they did in subbing the intro and endings is remarkable that this can somewhat be attempted now.

What I am happy about is episodes 62 to 75 since I was in control from the start. Every line is identical to R-F and timing is almost perfect. I was frame advancing most of the time. The problem? It took me about 2 weeks to do 62 to 75.

As one person I'm really struggling to do 75 episodes. We're talking multiple months if it wants to get to the level of say Episode 1 or 75. I asked for help on some forums and I do want to give a big thank you to llbx. Things they did:

1: Perfectly recreated the "Music is my Thing" karaoke ending that gabest11 did not get around to (starts episode 64). That was one of the last big hurdles for anyone wanting to actually properly restore the subs.

2: Perfectly recreated the episode 75 ending karaoke! This was the last big hurdle for a successful sub.

3: Perfectly recreated the episode title animations. These will be put on all episodes. E-F/R-F only started doing these properly about halfway in, so let's do it from the start.

It's funny because even with the subs in this state, it's still the best subs for this anime. Why? At the bare minimum you get the subs already available elsewhere, but you get the added opening and ending karaoke parts from start to finish for every episode.

As I type it's January 2nd 2026. Having to go retime and style 3-61 plus properly sub the Igo sections is a big task. I'm glad I put enough effort in to have this in a state where it's basically just a time investment now.

If anyone ever sees this and has a passion to properly finish... I'd like to see it done. I thought to myself even if I had 2 other people, that's only 20 episodes each and could probbaly be done in 3 weeks (trust me you get faster).

You can reach me on Discord at gameinn1 or make an Issues post. If you need it visualized of what work needs to be done, below is a table.

Update: January 4th 2026. I've decided to restore the AonE subs for the New Year Special (Episode 76). This will be uploaded to give more eyes on the project. It's over an hour and I have to start from scratch so probably a week or so. The current DVD/Blu-Ray subs are bad (mainly timing wise) and needs done.

Update: January 9th 2026. The New Year/Hokuto Cup special (ep 76) has been fully subbed! As for the main episodes, I may consider doing an episode per week (starting from 3) but for now I am looking at getting the special uploaded to get more eyes on the project.

Below is old info. Leaving here for completion sake.

Changelog since starting (sorry for how this is all laid out I barely know how Github works).

Fixed a typo/grammar in the R-F sub episode 62. "A bluff? He's doesn't do stuff like that" to "A bluff? He doesn't do stuff like that".

Subbed 62. Considering doing the extra Go sections at the end of each episode. Will see but since gabest11 didn't do them, would need to sub them all first.

Fixed typo in intro of episode 61 by gabest11. "wth my wings spread out." to "with my wings spread out."

Done 63 and here is where I considered changing colours for styles. gabest11 "Noise" style was wrong compared to E-F/R-F. gabest11 was italic, alignment 8. It should be bold, alignment 2. Changed "Noise" to "Background" as it makes more sense.

I color picked Background again (now it's &H00C5FEC1) but unsure if it's totally faithful (maybe it's 99%).

Also made a Sai "Blue" styling (&H00FEFECE) for earlier E-F (this got dropped later on by E-F/R-F but let's recreate it as best we can)

Made a "Memory" purple styling that shows up as early as episode 1. gabest11 also did not do this style.

The main idea is to just get things subbed and then can worry about slight colour and changes later. I am mainly making sure that Thinking, Background, Sai and Memory are assigned properly. I will have to go back over gabest11 subs from scratch and apply "Memory" styling to more accurately reflect E-F/R-F.

Subbed 64 ending (music is my thing) with help from someone. This is the main hurdle done!

Small note: In Episode 74, there is actually a difference between the TV broadcast and Blu-Ray. At about 4:32, Shindou talks about doing a Suberi and "If I want to win.". Those lines are not in the TV broadcast at all and that line of Suberi actually plays as he puts the stone down on R-F about 8 seconds later but it makes more sense for that to be "There you go!". If that's wrong then someone can let me know.

Below is a small changelog for episode 1:

Took some liberties with E-F sub styling for episode 1. For example during the memory sequence of Sai and Hikaru (starting around 4:36 on E-F), E-F did this with Default styling but it really should be Background styling. They even apply the Background styling sometimes (e.g. "What are you?" at 4:41) so I guess they just forgot to apply it in places. They also applied Background to Sai talking (4:37) instead of the Sai styling which makes more sense.

Around 11:54 they styled Hikaru as Sai so that got changed to Background which again seems to make the most sense. I started to apply the Thinking style starting with Touya saying "That's the way a beginner holds a stone...". E-F only started doing the Thinking style in later episodes but no reason not to do it from the start. As things progressed I realise I should be doing small improvements like this.

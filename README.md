# HikaruNoGoSSA
Hello everyone. This is an update to the project started by gabest11.

Restoration of the original Hikaru No Go fansub in Substation Alpha (SSA) format, done by Elite-Fansubs [E-F] / Real Fansubbers [R-F].

The used fonts are in fonts.7z, either extract and right click install them, or use mkvmerge to multiplex it with the episodes.

## Progress
- 2-61 wip (gabest11 work needs relooked at)
- 1 and 62-66 done by me (these I am confident in since I did them)
- Yes if you're wondering the "Music is my Thing" ending has been painstakingly recreated. It's frame perfect to R-F. Check 64 onwards.

Changelog since starting (sorry for how this is all laid out I barely know how Github works).

Fixed a typo/grammar in the R-F sub episode 62. "A bluff? He's doesn't do stuff like that" to "A bluff? He doesn't do stuff like that".

Subbed 62. Considering doing the extra Go sections at the end of each episode. Will see but since gabest11 didn't do them, would need to sub them all first.

Fixed typo in intro of episode 61 by gabest11. "wth my wings spread out." to "with my wings spread out."

Done 63 and here is where I considered changing colours for styles. gabest11 "Noise" style was wrong compared to E-F/R-F. gabest11 was italic, alignment 8. It should be bold, alignment 2. Changed to "Background" as it makes more sense.

I color picked Backkground again (now it's &H00C5FEC1) but unsure if it's totally faithful (maybe it's 99%).

Also made a Sai "Blue" styling (&H00FEFECE) for earlier E-F (this got dropped later on by E-F/R-F but let's recreate it as best we can)

Made a "Memory" purple styling that shows up as early as episode 1. gabest11 also did not do this style.

The main idea is to just get things subbed and then can worry about slight colour and changes later. I am mainly making sure that Thinking, Background, Sai and Memory are assigned properly. I will have to go back over gabest11 subs from scratch and apply "Memory" styling to more accurately reflect E-F/R-F.

Subbed 64 ending (music is my thing) with help from someone. This is the main hurdle done!

-------------------------------------------
When I started this project I assumed that the work done by gabest11 was close to done but it's really not. To show the stark differences, please look at my episode 1 comapred to theirs. They did not even assign styling at all.

If this really needs done properly I will first need to finish subbing 67 to 75 and then basically redo 2-61. Below is a small changelog for episode 1:

Took some liberties with E-F sub styling for episode 1. For example during the memory sequence of Sai and Hikaru (starting around 4:36 on E-F), E-F did this with Default styling but it really should be Background styling. They even apply the Background styling sometimes (e.g. "What are you?" at 4:41) so I guess they just forgot to apply it in places. They also applied Background to Sai talking (4:37) instead of the Sai styling which makes more sense.

Around 11:54 they styled Hikaru as Sai so that got changed to Background which again seems to make the most sense. I started to apply the Thinking style starting with Touya saying "That's the way a beginner holds a stone...". E-F only started doing the Thinking style in later episodes but no reason not to do it from the start. As things progressed I realise I should be doing small improvements like this.

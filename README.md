Changelog since starting (sorry for how this is all laid out I barely know how Github works).

Fixed a typo/grammar in the R-F sub episode 62. "A bluff? He's doesn't do stuff like that" to "A bluff? He doesn't do stuff like that".

Subbed 62. Considering doing the extra Go sections at the end of each episode. Will see but since gabest11 didn't do them, would need to sub them all first.

Fixed typo in intro of episode 61 by gabest11. "wth my wings spread out." to "with my wings spread out."

Done 63 and here is where I considered changing colours for styles. gabest11 "Noise" style was wrong compared to E-F/R-F. gabest11 was italic, alignment 8. It should be bold, alignment 2. Changed to "Background" as it makes more sense.

I color picked Background again (now it's &H00C5FEC1) but unsure if it's totally faithful (maybe it's 99%).

Also made a Sai "Blue" styling (&H00FEFECE) for earlier E-F (this got dropped later on by E-F/R-F but let's recreate it as best we can)

Made a "Memory" purple styling that shows up as early as episode 1. gabest11 also did not do this style.

The main idea is to just get things subbed and then can worry about slight colour and changes later. I am mainly making sure that Thinking, Background, Sai and Memory are assigned properly. I will have to go back over gabest11 subs from scratch and apply "Memory" styling to more accurately reflect E-F/R-F.

Subbed 64 ending (music is my thing) with help from someone. This is the main hurdle done!

Small note: In Episode 74, there is actually a difference between the TV broadcast and Blu-Ray. At about 4:32, Shindou talks about doing a Suberi and "If I want to win.". Those lines are not in the TV broadcast at all and that line of Suberi actually plays as he puts the stone down on R-F about 8 seconds later but it makes more sense for that to be "There you go!". If that's wrong then someone can let me know.

-------------------------------------------
When I started this project I assumed that the work done by gabest11 was close to done but it's really not. To show the stark differences, please look at my episode 1 comapred to theirs. They did not even assign styling at all.

If this really needs done properly I will first need to finish subbing 67 to 75 and then basically redo 2-61. Below is a small changelog for episode 1:

Took some liberties with E-F sub styling for episode 1. For example during the memory sequence of Sai and Hikaru (starting around 4:36 on E-F), E-F did this with Default styling but it really should be Background styling. They even apply the Background styling sometimes (e.g. "What are you?" at 4:41) so I guess they just forgot to apply it in places. They also applied Background to Sai talking (4:37) instead of the Sai styling which makes more sense.

Around 11:54 they styled Hikaru as Sai so that got changed to Background which again seems to make the most sense. I started to apply the Thinking style starting with Touya saying "That's the way a beginner holds a stone...". E-F only started doing the Thinking style in later episodes but no reason not to do it from the start. As things progressed I realise I should be doing small improvements like this.
